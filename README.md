# Python practices 

- This is based on Coursera Hands-on Lab: Building a API with Flask: Route Creation, Error Handling and HTTP Requests
- Practice creating a small RESTful API
- work with application level error handlers for common errors like:

-> 404 NOT FOUND
-> 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

- use @app.route to create route for desired path and use methods to clarify GET, POST, DELETE method for the API
